# Car Luxury Add-Ons

## Overview

This is a Zomboid Mod (my first one) that is going to add some "Luxury" features to all vehicles with the intention of making them safer and saving resources.

## Current Add-Ons

In the upcoming sections I'm going to describe the Add-Ons currently available with a brief description of their behavior and the intention behind their creation.

### Auto-Lock Doors

This first Add-On was created, because we often forget to lock doors when we start driving a vehicle and this can expose us to an enemy opening an unlocked door.

This Add-On gets activated when your vehicle speed goes over **25km/h** and doesn't get automatically de-activated. Also I'm not automatically locking the hood or boot.

### Stop/Start

This Add-On was created with the intention of saving petrol, since in most of the game modes this is a very scarce resource.

This Add-On gets activated when your vehicle speed get below **1km/h**. Once your speed gets too low I assume you're stopping the vehicle and stop the engine to save petrol, if you try to drive again after **Stop/Start** was activated your vehicle will get to **running** immediately, avoiding the **starting** process since the engine was previously started.

## Upcoming Add-Ons

The very next Luxury Add-On I would like to create is the **Auto Lights** where I'm going to turn the headlights on everytime the exterior light gets too low.

## Upcoming Improvements

I'm planning to create a custom Menu Tab where I'll allow the customization of the Add-Ons, for example, I would like to allow the selection of which door(s) will be locked by **Auto-Lock Doors** and which speed it gets activated.
